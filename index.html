  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>For this assignment, I collected some feedback from one of my friends, who said that the website looked nice except for the logo was missing. I think the logo was the hardest part of the project for me as I tried everything but couldn't make it. I think through this project, I learned how much actual effort goes into creating nice and pretty website layouts. I also got feedback saying to change the font of the text, which I did not choose to do since I think the font I chose works pretty well with grabbing attention of the user while not making it hard to read since a lot of the text has a dark background color. </p>
  <p>If I had to start the project over, I would probably try to do the other project instead of SpaceX, just for the experience. I would have also liked for me to put more effort into the project. </p>
  <p>This class was probably my best class for the semester; I was actually more interested in frontend work than I had though to be. At first, CSS seemed very confusing with selectors but after trying a couple times, I seemed to understand the concept a bit better although I still am not confident aobut it.</p>

  <h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing</h2>
  <p>As far as I understand, progressive enhacement is a concept that involves building websites in layers, with a basic foundation that all users can access and adding more features fo users with modern browsers. This design philosophy makes sure that all users can access the core content and functionality, regardless of browser/device, while still making sure that there are advanced features for users with latest technology.</p>
  <p>Progressive enhacement is very important for modern web development as it allows developers to create websites that are accessible, inclusive, and future-proof. By starting with a basic and accessible foundation, developers can make sure that their website works on older devices/browsers, or on devices with slow connection. Users with more advanced devices/browsers, will be able to access more advanced features and functionality. </p>
  <p>Since progressive enhancement makes sure that everything is a separate layer(html,css,javascript), websites can easily be updated and adapted as new technologies and devices emerge. Developers would remain confident that their website is flexible and adaptable to changes in technology and the chance of it breaking down is less. </p>
  <p>Another article I found while reading about this topic, on FreeCodeCamp.org that provides an overview of the concept including examples and practical tips of implementation. The article emphasizes the importance of a strong foundation with html and css and then building on top of that with javascript. It was a helpful and informative article. </p>
